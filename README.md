# Cozy
This is the repository of my "Web Applications" exam. It contains a website model of a bed and breakfast app.  
The design was made with Adobe XD.  
It has been developed using mainly Node, Express and MongoDB. No view renderers are used.  
In the client I have used LeafletJS as a dynamic map renderer and ChartJS to draw the price charts.
